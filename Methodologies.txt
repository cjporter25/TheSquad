TESTING IDEAS
	In case something goes wrong and data was added incorrectly, have an algorithm
	to reset data points in the database so the system can be ran through again. (DONE)
	Test Member data accuracy by ensuring matches lost + matches played equals total 
	matches.
	Validate number of matches played for each member individually, the squad total,
	and a manual count of all matchID's for a given match type.
