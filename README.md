# TheSquad

•	TheSquad is a personally designed service tool for players of the popular multiplayer online battle arena game, League of Legends - Riot Games, Inc. 
This service focuses on providing users with interesting, fun, and useful metrics about how a specific group of players perform together.
•	After gaining approval through the Riot Games Developer program, the data necessary is accessed by making requests to their proprietary API. 
This data is then (1) examined via a local data model that defines what a Squad is, (2) a series of algorithms then performs analyses on this model, 
(3) a logic center facilitates the organization and output of the resulting data, and (4) uses a connection to a cloud based Firestore database for 
permanent storage.
•	In contrast to similar web applications that compile and present data to the player, TheSquad instead derives insightful metrics about a group of 
players rather than the individual. A future goal of mine is to port these services to a user interactive public web application. As a bonus, this 
project greatly improved personal proficiency with external industry API’s and databases, Python, JSON formatting, and more.
